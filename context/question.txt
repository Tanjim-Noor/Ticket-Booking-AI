Objective: Create a bus ticket booking application that allows users to search for buses, book tickets, view their bookings, and access bus-specific information.

Available Data: You are provided with a dataset that includes

- Districts and their dropping points
- Bus providers and their routes with fares
- Each bus provider has a file containing their privacy policy and contact information

Task Requirements:

- Allow users to book a ticket by providing basic information (name and phone number)
- Store bookings and allow users to view or cancel them
- Display bus provider details to users using the files provided
- Provide a web interface for users to interact with

Application Design:

- The database used must be self-hosted/Dockerized 
- Using developer prompts or system prompts to store the provided data is strictly prohibited
- Participants should be judged based on how the application is structured
- Participants must demonstrate a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline in the application
- Build a complete application with both backend (FastAPI) and frontend
- Handle all operations needed to search for buses, manage bookings, and retrieve bus details
- Include a `README.md` with instructions on how to run the application

Example Questions:

- “Are there any buses from Dhaka to Rajshahi under 500 taka?”
- “Show all bus providers operating from Chittagong to Sylhet.”
- “What are the contact details of Hanif Bus?”
